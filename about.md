My name is Edward Feng, and I am a high schooler in the good ol' U.S. of A.

I mainly use Github and Github Pages as a way to store/manage/access my notes. I use Atom, alongside the MPE plugin writing in markdown.

I go to BCA, as a CompSci student, so I hope to learn more, especially about computers, and will (hopefully) be able to edit this site more to my liking.

I think that's all, for now.
